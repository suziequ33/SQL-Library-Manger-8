# SQL-Library-Manger-8
 Using SQL database to implement a dynamic website using JavaScript, Node.js, Epress, Pug SQLite and SQL ORM Sequelize.

 //I followed the example project for the outline for this project-file example. 
 Using Sequelize ORM with Express notes walked through the first parts of the project
 I had trubble with the html example files and converting them to pug files.
 Until I looked closer at the project-files and needed to extend out from the layout. 
 I did not read way at the bottom of the Getting Started page about the library.db file being the database. 
Oh I kept getting errors with the pug file. / they are very case sensitive. I like to add blank line at the end. They do not like it. 
I also deleted the first book The Hunger Games. So I added a few of my favorite books.
